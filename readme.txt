so far..

main.py has a class categories, genres

-- Categories - movies, tv shows, music, etc (This may be split up further because of the processing differences between them, but at the core they will be
categories (even if categories is a a base inheritance))

-- Genres - Genres are for seperating base categories (rock, jazz, dubstep | horro, comedy, romcom etc)

-- Tags - Tags are for further clustering genres and other things


i REALLY need to make the orm query able to search based off mutiple args, I am trying to make this all from scratch for now (just for 'fun' and suffering)
but I want it to be easily suited to changing over to something like django and sql. That is probably the direction this will need to go into.

but for now I enjoy coding things that I could easily just import :)
